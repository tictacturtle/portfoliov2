                            <p style= font-size:16px> The App development project involved creating an app from an idea, to a prototype, to a functioning app. Our idea was an app called Smooth that suggested smoothie recipies for people based on their dietary restrictions because we knew that not enough people were aware of how nutritious and delicious smoothies are. We developed our prototype in proto.io to have an idea of the basic wireframe and buttons. We developed a navigation tab at the bottom to easily navigate between pages. Ultimately we used React JavaScript to code the app since we could collaborate on the code through Visual Studio. We received user input on the user interface, which is why our ui was very aesthetically pleasing for our app. Using Expo we were able to view updates to the code live on a phone, which helped speed up the process of trial and error.

                            <p style= font-size:16px> The Chatbot project was when we were challenged to build a chatbot. We had lots of flexibility on the chatbot after experimenting with different chatbots online. We chose to have a chatbot that we could actually use so we brainstormed ideas related to school. Since our group members were split on the specific class we could make the chatbot an expert in, we chose to focus on school in general. The Dovi Chatbot is a chatbot that helps students by giving them encouraging messages about tests and grades. Our main feature was that the code is able to scrape the infinite campus site in order to log into the grade portal to access the grades. This project was interesting because we were able to choose a topic of our choice and research about chatbot extensions.

                            <p style= font-size:16px> The Entrepreneurship project was a four person group project that required groups to think of a unique product and use skills learned in the class to develop it. After brainstorming, we decided on a product called RePly that would send a notification to janitors telling them when a bathroom stall had run out of toilet paper. Throughout the project I focused on building a large scale physical prototype out of VEX parts as well as writing code on ROBOTC that would go along with the model. I also increased our marketability by working on a cost breakdown slide for our presentation. Our three-part system, which included the sensor in the stall, a base in the bathroom, and an app would be marketed towards large businesses and sports arenas rather than schools, which have considerable amounts of vandalism. It would utilize an ultrasonic sensor to sense when the toilet paper roll was out of toilet paper, ensuring that janitors do not waste time and energy making rounds to every stall to check if it is empty. Overall, we were also able to utilize the public speaking skills that we developed in the class to secure a place in the final presentation portion of the competition.

                            <p style= font-size:16px> The Solar Hydrogen Vehicle Project was a four person project that required a recommendation for Tesla Motors, regarding whether they should use solar or hydrogen fuel and how they should wire the cells on a bread board. For this project our group had to test various configurations of fuel cells on a vehicle of our design for efficiency, speed, and practicality. During the project, I mainly focused on documentation, as well as the more technical aspects of the project such as breadboarding. I ran the tests and organized the time results on the final documentation. After many rebuilds of our vehicle, we were able to test with 1 solar cell, 2 solar cells, 1 hydrogen cell, and 2 hydrogen cells, with 2 of those configured in parallel and the other two in series. After our testing we concluded that the solar allowed for greater speeds with our vehicle, however it was not practical to be the only source of energy for a car since cars at Tesla need to run at night time too. We ultimately recommended 2 solar cells wired in parallel to Tesla, so that if one malfunctions then the other continues, however we also noted that hydrogen fuel cells would be useful to have in backup emergencies, though they are dangerous and take time to charge in our case.

                                <p style= font-size:16px> The Image Manipulation Project was a two person project that surrounded the vast topic of image manipulation. Groups were asked to choose one of four clients (cause, family, product, or developer) to aim their manipulation towards. An example of a family oriented project would be putting a border around an image of a family provided. The code had to work on any image that was selected and put into a specific images folder, meaning that it could not be particular based on height, width, color, or even transparency. We brainstormed a couple of ideas such as having a transparent font or making only the distinct features of an image (the eyes, mouth, and nose if it was a picture of a person) visible. We ended up going with the transparent text. This was relatively simple since we just had to make a transparent mask with the word 100% transparent and the rest of the background only 40% transparent. We were able to apply our project to many of the clients and could easily change the word printed in the mask. If we continued with this project we could have written code to make a mask of a word using coordinates that are relative to the size of the image provided. Ultimately we reached our goal of making a product that would be of use to our clients, the family and the cause.

                            <p style= font-size:16px> The App Inventor Project was a two person project in which we first built a basic game from a given tutorial and then brainstormed and implemented new features that we thought would enhance the game. For this project, my partner, Matt, and I chose to build a game similar to the popular game Flappy Bird. The player would tap the screen to make the bird jump and the bird would fall if not tapped. The object of the game was to maneuver the bird around spiked pegs that randomly stuck out the side of the screen. For this game we implemented features such as a pause/resume button, a coin system, and just began working on a shop system before the final gallery walk. Unfortunately we could not get the shop system to work in time, which taught us a common problem in the programming world. We learned that it is important to understand your abilities so that you can realistically plan how much you can achieve, and not give your client the feeling of false hope when you agree to code what they want. Overall this project was great for learning about how to work as a team to achieve a common goal, how to plan realistically to predict what you can accomplish in a time period, and how to properly tailor an app to the cusotmer. </p>

                            <p style= font-size:16px> The Scratch Project was a two person project that involved the program Scratch. For this project we had to choose to develop either a story or a game using the language that Scratch provides. My partner, Ryan, and I decided to make a game based off of a game that we had both played previously. It centered around eating creatures smaller than you and avoiding creatures bigger than you until you reach a certain amount of points. During this project I learned how to work in a team while programming as well as how to change our game for the benefit of the players of the game. The flowcharts and documentation helped me understand that sharing how your game or product with others is one of the most important parts of a job in this field. A main component of this game was variables since there was lots of data such as score and energy to keep track of. You can play our project by clicking the play button to the right.
