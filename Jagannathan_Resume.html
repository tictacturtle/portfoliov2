                                            <p style= font-size:16px> In the summer before my senior year, I spent 6 weeks interning at the Cognition and Decision Lab at Boston University under Professor Joseph McGuire. Through the Boston Research in Science and Engineering (RISE) program, I spent more than 35 hours a week in the lab. I focused specifically on the use of pupil diameter as a measurement of surprise and effort during cognitive tasks. I learned MatLab from scratch and was given freedom to analyze and explore the data given to me. I ultimately found that there was a positive correlation between pupil diameter and both surprise and effort (measured in response time). At the end of the program I presented my findings in a poster symposium. Aside from building technical skills, being able to ask my lab members questions regarding a career in a STEM field was a priceless opportunity as I chose my college major and planned for my future career.   </p>

                                                <p style= font-size:16px> As a member of the Dublin High School Engineering Academy, I was paired with a mentor in my career field of interest during my junior year of highschool. My mentor Claire Robertson is a Biomedical Engineer and Postdoctoral Fellow at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory specializing in cell biology. Throughout the program we met once a month and discussed various topics necessary for a successful career such as goal setting, networking, and college planning. She offered me valuable advice on what interviewers are looking for in candidates who are applying, which will be very useful to me for summer programs as well as when I enter the workforce after college. Her edits to my resume helped me utilize the little space I had to better represent my skills and goals. Because her interests aligned with mine, she was also able to inform me about research opportunities in college as well as study abroad programs, both of which I am planning to do in whichever college I choose. Her experiences at UCSD and UCI make me more excited to go to college and pursue a career that I will enjoy working in. Having the opportunity to have a mentor like this who is actually in the field was very valuable and helped me understand the areas that I need to improve in before going to college or starting a career. The level of professionalism we maintained through emails also helped me be more confident in my communication skills online and prepared me for future professional emails I would send.

                                                    <p style= font-size:16px> During my high school career I have had many field trip opportunities offered to me through the Engineering Academy. One field trip that was especially valuable to me was the field trip that we had to Google and Santa Clara University. Going to the Google office legitimized all the rumors about the fun and energetic work environment that the company strives to achieve. It was amazing to hear the stories of all of the individuals working there, seeing as no two people had the same path in terms to their education and final career. The second half of the day we visited Santa Clara University and had an inside look into the resources available to the engineering students on campus. While schools such as Berkeley and MIT are well known for their academic success, visiting SCU taught me that smaller schools are actually more immersive. The college had tons of equipment such as a machine to test the ductility of metal and another machine that measures lift and drag on an airplane wing. As I apply for colleges in the coming years, I will now be sure to take the school size into account, since I want to have a hands-on experience in college to prepare me for the workforce later on. Another field trip that I enjoyed was the SHE Leads conference. The workshop brought women together to empower high school girls to join the STEM field. During this field trip I was inspired by the motivational stories of the women speakers and learned about civil engineering and mental health in different workshops. It was exciting to be surrounded by so many girls interested in science and engineering and I’m excited to have that same atmosphere at the college I choose to attend.

These talks provide us insight into different fields of engineering, as well as the education necessary to enter the workforce. One speaker that opened my eyes to the applications of engineering was Maynard Holliday. Mr. Holliday worked on the Chernobyl project, dealing with engineering a dome that would enclose the radiation exposed after the Chernobyl accident in Russia. During his time in Russia, he had to deal with a language barrier, however he noted that mathematics and science were universal. Mr.Holliday’s speech moved me so much because it reinforced the idea that engineering has the potential to save thousands of lives. The traditional computer programmer sitting behind a desk may not be directly affecting the physical lives of civilians as Mr. Holliday did, however they could be contributing to the coding of mobile devices that will improve the ease of life for thousands of civilians as well. With such a daunting task, it can be stressful at times to plan and brainstorm, however I really admired Mr. Holliday’s enthusiasm and pure passion towards his job. Another speaker we had in my AP Computer Science class was Jason Yosinski. Jason works in the Artificial Intelligence department at Uber. It was amazing to me how Jason was able to take the complex topic of neural networks and explain it in a way that me and my fellow classmates could understand. I was so interested by the work he was doing that I asked a follow-up question at the end of class regarding the biases that AI tends to develop based on the information it is trained on. This provided overlap between my Cognitive Science interests and the Artificial Intelligence field.
