My interests lie in combining my fascination for the lab work that biology provides with the analytical possibilities of computer science. In order to prepare for a career in this interdisciplinary field, I have taken courses and have completed an internship related to both Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science. The summer after 9th grade I attended a Cognitive Neuroscience course at UC Berkeley. This course introduced me to the basic biology of the brain as well as the cognitive processes that it undergoes. As part of the course, we had to write a mock research paper on a topic of our choice. I chose to research the neurological effects of runner’s high having experienced it myself as an avid runner. Not only did the research paper prepare me for future scientific papers I would write, but it also sparked my passion for Neuroscience by relating it to running - an activity that I have always loved. Classes such as AP Biology, AP Computer Science, and Biotechnology have also prepared me with the lab skills, problem-solving skills, and foundational knowledge to pursue a career in the STEM field. </p>

                                <p style= font-size:16px class =  'g'>In the summer before my senior year, I spent 6 weeks interning at the Cognition and Decision Lab at Boston University under Professor Joseph McGuire. Through the Boston Research in Science and Engineering (RISE) program, I spent more than 35 hours a week in the lab. I focused specifically on the use of pupil diameter as a measurement of surprise and effort during cognitive tasks. Once I learned Matlab I was free to analyze and explore the data given to me. The internship was a perfect test of both my biology knowledge and my computer science knowledge. Aside from building technical skills, being able to ask my lab members questions regarding a career in a STEM field was a priceless opportunity as I chose my college major and planned for my future career. Interning at the lab made me realize that I want to pursue a career in research after I graduate from college.  I think it would be interesting to try research in academia as well as in the industry to see which one I enjoy more. Regardless, I know that research will be a part of my professional goals because of the emphasis on curiosity and discovery which I am naturally driven by. In the near future I hope to do research at whichever college I choose to attend as well as study abroad to broaden my perspective on the world.

I run on my high school’s cross country and track teams and often find myself integrating this my love for the sport into academic projects. Running has set the foundation for discipline, perseverance, and gratification in other facets of my life. I am also very interested in the concept of sustainability and practice it on an individual level through my vegetarian diet and conscious shopping. When I'm not in school, I choose to spend my free time reading sci-fi and dystopian novels because I want to be prepared if and when technology really does take over, even though I’ll probably be behind it given my inclination towards STEM courses and fields.
